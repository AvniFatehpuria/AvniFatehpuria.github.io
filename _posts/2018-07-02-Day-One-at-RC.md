title: Day One at the RC!
date:2018-07-02

It's been such a full day! After group orientation activities, there was a lot of structured and unstructured time to talk to Recursers - both 
people who are starting today and people who have been here for six weeks. 
I was blown away by the diversity of the projects people are interested in and have worked on, and I'm so excited to learn with them for the next 
twelve weeks. Conversations with people helped me decide to dip my toe into the world of web development by making a simple personal website that
I can also use to blog my journey at the RC and track the progress I'm making and the things I'm learning. I had a couple false starts, and then
finally found a tutorial that I am now (pretty loosely) following, and I think I'm going to finish by the end of the day. 

## Stuff I did today:
 - Made this website
