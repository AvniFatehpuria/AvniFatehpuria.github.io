title: Week One at the RC!

Week 1 at the RC was shorter than most because of the 4th of July, but it was still so full and incredibly productive!

I've started working towards my goal of better understanding and being able to use machine intelligence by beginning working through 
[Google's machine learning crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course). I'm hoping to finish that by today 
or tomorrow, ideally. 

Elsa and I also continued work on Spoon Game, our working title for a multiplayer game we've been building in Java about co-operation and chronic illness. 
It took a fair amount of time to refamiliarise ourselves with the codebase, and we also brainstormed for a while and now have a far clearer idea
of what we want gameplay to actually be like. I feel like we had gotten so lost in the details of implementation and the conncepts we wanted to convey that
we lost sight of what players would actually be doing ingame, and I'm so glad it's rectified and eager to keep working on it. 

I also started to learn JavaScript! Ive built (most of) a game called BlockPong, a co-operative fusion between ping-pong and breakdown. 
By the end of this week, I'm hoping to put it on the internet. Here's' what I still have to accomplish before I can do that:

- Create a home page
- Let people name their teams
- Track high scores(?)
- Add a how-to page(?)
- Figure out how to host it
- Add levels
- Give players more control over the direction they send the balls
- Make it prettier(?); this would mean selecting an using palettes instead of randomly selecting colors

Some of these are more important than others, and I might not do all these things, but it seems like a pretty reasonable plan for now. 
I'm also considering taking a little break from actively working on the game to figure out what good web design should look like.
I'm hoping that continuing to talk to the more experienced web develpers at RC will keep helping with that, but it would also be nice to find some useful resources I can peruse.
